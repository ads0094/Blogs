    "text": "Australia’s property market has been a topic of intense discussion, with prices continuing to rise despite economic headwinds. As of September 2024, while the national trend shows a slowing in price growth, there remains significant variation across different cities. This ongoing divergence reflects the complex interplay of factors such as population growth, migration, housing shortages, and fluctuating interest rates. At the same time, regulatory measures introduced to curb unsustainable growth have left their mark. In this blog, we’ll explore the key drivers behind these trends and consider what lies ahead for Australia’s property market in both the short and long term.\n\nWhat’s Going on in the Australian Property Market?\nAs of September 2024, Australia’s national home prices continue to rise, though the pace of growth has slowed. Over the three months leading to July 2024, national home values increased by 1.7%, compared to around 3% during the same period last year. This slowdown reflects a shift in the housing market’s dynamics, as rising interest rates, economic factors, and regulatory changes take hold.\nOne key observation is the widening gap in capital growth across different cities. The range of growth between cities is now at its highest since 2006, a period marked by Australia’s mining boom. For example, while Perth experienced a 6% increase in property values over the quarter, Melbourne saw a 1% decline. This highlights a trend where more affordable cities—such as Perth, Brisbane, and Adelaide—are performing better, while traditionally expensive markets like Sydney and Melbourne are cooling off.\n\n\n\nOverall property prices in Melbourne have declined by 1.4% compared to the previous year, and there was a further 0.1% decline in the past month.\n\n\nInterestingly, Brisbane has now overtaken Melbourne to become the second most expensive city in Australia in terms of median dwelling prices. As of 2024, Brisbane’s median house price is 2.5% higher than Melbourne’s, signaling a shift in market preferences toward more affordable, yet growing cities. In Adelaide, median house prices have skyrocketed by 40% between June 2020 and June 2023, making it less affordable in relation to local incomes, even though it remains a more affordable city nationally.\n\n\n\nSource: CoreLogic\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are the Long-Term Drivers of Home Prices in Australia?\nSeveral factors have driven long-term home price increases in Australia, most notably:\n\nAustralia has seen strong population growth, partly due to high levels of migration, especially from international students and workers.\nSince the mid-2010s, Australia has struggled with a chronic housing shortage, exacerbated by limited land availability, construction delays, and restrictive zoning laws.\nHistorically low interest rates encouraged buyers to take out mortgages, increasing demand for homes. When interest rates were low, many Australians rushed to buy homes, leading to bidding wars and pushing prices up, even amid a housing shortage. The relationship between rising mortgage rates and housing prices is clear in recent years. Higher borrowing costs have significantly reduced the affordability of homes, contributing to a cooling housing market. Both economic conditions and monetary policy will continue to shape this dynamic moving forward.\n\nAdditionally, the uneven affordability across different regions is influencing internal migration, with people moving to more affordable cities like Perth and Adelaide, further straining the limited supply in those areas.\n\n\nIs the Situation Similar to the Pre-GFC Housing Bubble?\nWhile there are concerns about housing affordability, Australia’s situation differs from the pre-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) housing bubble. Since the GFC, Australia has implemented several prudent lending practices. Regulatory bodies like APRA have tightened lending standards, imposing caps on high-risk loans, including interest-only mortgages and investor lending. These regulations, combined with Responsible Lending Obligations, ensure that borrowers are carefully assessed before loans are approved, reducing the risk of a housing bubble.\n\n\n\n\nMortgage arrears chart\n\n\n\n\nNon-performing loans (loans at least 90 days overdue) have increased to 0.93% of all loans, which is slightly higher than at the onset of the pandemic (0.92%). Loans 30-89 days overdue represent 0.68% of loans, up from 0.35% in 2022, and this is the highest level since Q2 2020. The average variable interest rate on outstanding home loans rose from 2.86% in April 2022 to 6.39% in March 2024, significantly increasing monthly repayment burdens.\n\nIn addition, Australian banks are required to hold higher capital reserves to protect the financial system from shocks, further stabilising the market. As a result, even during economic downturns or when interest rates rise sharply, the housing market tends to remain relatively stable. For example, mortgage arrears currently sit at around 1.6%, indicating that most homeowners are still able to service their loans despite financial pressures.\n\nWhat Would Happen If Unemployment Rose Sharply?\nA sharp rise in unemployment could pose risks to the housing market, particularly in terms of mortgage defaults. If more people were unable to service their mortgages, there would likely be an increase in forced sales, leading to downward pressure on property prices. However, Australia’s current economic indicators suggest that a sharp rise in unemployment is unlikely. The unemployment rate has remained stable at around 4.2% as of mid-2024, and forecasts suggest only mild increases over the next year. The government and central bank are also carefully managing economic policies to avoid shocks that could lead to significant job losses.\n\n\n\nOwner-Occupied Boom\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a boom in owner-occupied homes, driven by low interest rates, government stimulus packages, and a shift in preferences for larger living spaces due to remote work. As a result, demand for homes soared, particularly in outer suburbs and more affordable cities, which caused property prices to rise. This trend marked a significant shift from investor-driven growth to owner-occupier-driven growth, as more Australians sought to purchase homes to live in rather than rent out.\n\n\nWhat to Expect?\nIn the short term, property prices are expected to continue rising at a slower rate nationally, but the degree of change will vary significantly between regions. Not all suburbs will see price increases, and some cities may experience stagnation or even declines. For instance, Melbourne could become more affordable, with house prices rising by only 1% in the last quarter. This slow growth could provide some relief for potential buyers in the city.\nFundamentally, most homeowners are reluctant to see their property values decline, as many Australians have taken on substantial debt to afford homeownership. This creates little incentive for policies that could drive down home prices. However, to address the affordability crisis and relieve pressure on the housing market, government reforms encouraging downsizing and increasing high-density housing will be crucial. Building more units through both public and private sector initiatives will help alleviate supply constraints.\nOne potential solution could involve reallocating resources from large-scale infrastructure projects to housing construction. For example, Australia currently faces a shortage of construction workers, which is slowing the pace of housing development. Redirecting labor to homebuilding could accelerate construction rates and help meet demand. Lower homeownership also puts additional pressure on the rental market, which has seen significant price hikes in recent years due to limited supply. Increasing housing stock will not only stabilise home prices but also ease rental market pressures, benefitting both buyers and renters in the long term."

    "text": "In this blog I would like to briefly discuss the macroeconomic backdrop of China’s economy. China is Australia’s largest trading partner, accounting for nearly a third of all exports. It serves as the primary destination for many of Australia’s key goods and services, mainly resources such as coal, iron ore, and gold, making this bilateral economic relationship crucial to Australia’s economic prosperity.\nIn recent years, China’s economic slowdown has raised significant concerns among policymakers and economists worldwide regarding its potential impact on the global economy. As one of the largest consumers of energy, China plays a critical role in global demand for resources, and its decelerating growth has sparked questions about the future of macroeconomic stability, particularly for countries like Australia, which are heavily reliant on resource exports to China.\n\nAustralia-China bilateral trade\nAustralia’s exports to China are heavily dominated by resources and energy, such as iron ore, natural gas, and gold. As China’s economy evolves, particularly with its growing middle class, the trade relationship is diversifying to include premium agricultural products, financial services, healthcare, aged care, and professional services.\nChina surpassed $326.9 billion as Australia’s largest two-way trading partner in 2023, and continues to account for nearly a third of Australia’s exports. The goods and services export to China was valued at $218.8 billion in 2023, an increase of 18.2 per cent, compared to the previous financial year. Services exports soared 53.4 per cent in the same period, driven largely by the return of tourists and students to Australia.\n\n\nInvestment\nBy 2021, the total stock of two-way investment between Australia and China reached $166.8 billion. China was Australia’s 8th largest FD investor, with investments valued at $92 billion, while Australia’s investment in China stood at $74.8 billion, making it the 12th largest destination for Australian investments. In recent years, China’s investment in Australia has broadened from mainly mining to other sectors including infrastructure and healthcare.\n\n\nMacroeconomic Backdrop of China’s Economy\nOver the past decade, China has implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at transitioning its economy to a more market-oriented system. Key among these reforms has been the gradual liberalisation of the yuan (CNY) and interest rate policies. The People’s Bank of China has allowed the currency to fluctuate within a broader range, aligning more closely with market forces rather than being strictly managed by central authorities. Interest rate liberalisation has also been introduced to make the financial system more flexible and responsive to market conditions. In addition, China has actively promoted foreign investment, particularly in high-tech sectors, establishing itself as a leader in technology, anti-trust regulation, and the electric vehicle (EV) industry.\nDespite these advances, significant concerns remain about China’s economy. China’s debt-to-GDP ratio has surpassed 300%, which is considered alarmingly high by international standards. This debt burden, much of which is concentrated in local governments and state-owned enterprises, has raised doubts about the long-term sustainability of China’s growth model.\n\nLocal Government Debt and Ghost Cities\nThe root of many of China’s economic challenges stems from local governments being tasked with meeting aggressive GDP targets. In their quest to drive rapid growth, these governments often engaged in extensive infrastructure development, leading to the creation of so-called “ghost cities”—vast urban areas that remain largely unoccupied and fail to generate economic returns. These unproductive assets have become a major burden on local government finances, further contributing to China’s high debt levels.\n\n\nDeleveraging Efforts: The Three Red Lines Policy\nIn response to rising debt, the Chinese government introduced the Three Red Lines policy in 2020. This set strict limits on the borrowing capacity of property developers based on three key financial ratios: debt to cash assets, debt to equity, and debt to liabilities. The policy aimed to reduce the excessive leverage in the real estate sector but has inadvertently slowed growth, as developers faced liquidity issues and reduced construction activities. This deleveraging process has contributed to disinflation, where inflation rises at a slower pace, raising concerns about potential deflation. Deflation is problematic in an economy burdened by high debt, as it reduces profits, making it harder to service debt.\n\n\nDemographic Decline and Consumption Challenges\nThe introduction of the one-child policy in 1979 has resulted in a significant demographic decline in China, with fewer young people entering the workforce. This aging population has created structural challenges for consumption-led growth, as the most active consumers—those aged 20 to 45—are shrinking as a proportion of the population. Many young couples are deterred from having more children due to economic pressures and the responsibility of supporting elderly family members. This demographic trend has forced China to rely increasingly on export-led growth, deepening its dependence on global trade partners at a time when international tariffs and protectionist policies are rising.\n\n\nUncertain Business Environment and Regulation\nChinese companies are also navigating a complex regulatory landscape. The government’s deleveraging efforts, combined with external pressures such as tariffs on Chinese goods, have created uncertainty in the business environment. Deleveraging could lead to defaults, particularly in the property sector, where debt is highest. Moreover, as China seeks to maintain its economic model, there is a growing concern that Western countries may inadvertently subsidise this model through continued trade relations, despite existing trade tensions.\nIn summary, while China has made significant strides in reforming its economy, its high debt levels, demographic challenges, and reliance on external trade partners present substantial risks to its future stability.\n\n\n\nImplications for Australia\nIn recent years, tensions between the two nations led to a series of trade restrictions imposed by China on Australian exports. However, with the Labor government now in power, there has been a noticeable improvement in diplomatic relations, which has eased some of the economic pressures previously felt.\nDespite concerns that trade restrictions could hurt Australia’s trade balance, the country demonstrated remarkable economic resilience. During the height of the tensions, Australia’s trade surplus hit record levels. A significant factor in this success was Australia’s ability to diversify its export markets. While restrictions from China affected agricultural exports like barley and wine, Australia successfully redirected these exports to countries such as South-east Asia, and found newer markets for Australia’s agricultural products such as the UK. Similarly, Australia’s coal exports to China were disrupted during the trade conflict, which led Australia to seek alternative markets in Asia, particularly in countries like Japan and South Korea. By 2023, as diplomatic ties improved, China resumed importing Australian coal, further stabilising the energy export market.\n\nIron Ore and Industrial Demand\nIron ore, however, remains the cornerstone of Australia’s export relationship with China. Iron ore accounts for approximately 60% of Australia’s total exports to China, driven by China’s industrial needs, particularly in steel production. While China’s real estate market has faced a downturn, its demand for steel for infrastructure and industrial purposes remains robust. Given China’s substantial infrastructure projects and high nominal GDP, it is likely that iron ore demand will remain strong, even though real GDP growth has slowed in recent years.\n\n\nLong-Term Risks and Diversification Strategies\nAlthough Australia has successfully navigated the short-term impact of trade tensions with China, the long-term risks associated with its heavy reliance on iron ore exports remain. Any significant reduction in China’s steel production or a shift in demand for iron ore due to environmental policies could affect Australia’s trade balance. Additionally, increasing competition in the global iron ore market poses challenges for Australia. However, Australia’s diversification into new markets and sectors, such as renewable energy and other commodities, may help offset some of these risks over time.\nIn summary, while the Australia-China trade relationship has experienced challenges, Australia’s ability to adapt and diversify its export markets has allowed it to maintain economic stability. However, given its reliance on iron ore and China’s shifting economic policies, Australia must remain vigilant and continue exploring alternative markets to ensure long-term macroeconomic stability."
