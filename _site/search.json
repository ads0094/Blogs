    "text": "Sampling distribution\nIn the sampling distributions, each point on the x-axis represents the groups/sample performance (usually arithmetic mean).\n\nMean of the distribution of Means\nSampling distribution is when we take many samples from the population, compute the mean of the each of the samples and then create a distribution of the sample means obtained from all the samples by adding up all the sample means and dividing by the number of samples. This is different from the individual points within the sample. When there is only one sample, then the researcher would compute the mean and standard deviation to see how spread out the sample data is from its mean. Sampling distribution requires the researcher to compute the mean for many samples taken from the population and then create a distribution of the sample means. This allows the researcher to see how spread out the sample means are from each other, and the mean of sampling distribution (mean of the means of the distribution). This can look like this: \\(M_1=x_1, M_2=x_2, M_3=x_3, ... M_n=x_n\\). The sample distribution mean can be \\(\\bar X\\). This mean of the distribution of the sample means is equal to the parameter mean $\\mu$. Therefore, \\(M_M=\\mu\\) where \\(M_M\\) is the mean of the distribution of the sample means — a kind of super-mea\n\nStandard Error of the Mean\nStandard deviation Vs the Standard error of the mean\nThe SD of the sample is denoted by SD whereas the standard deviation of the population is denoted by the \\(\\sigma\\).\n\\(\\sigma\\) is used to measure the variability within the entire population.\nStandard deviation \\((s)\\) measures the variability within a sample. However, this variability is an estimate because the sample is only a part of the population.\nComparing the Two Standard Deviations: Distribution of Individual Scores vs. Distribution of Means, we know that the standard deviation of the sample means is also known as the standard error of the mean.\nThe standard deviation of the distribution of means ( \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}\\) ) or the standard error of the mean when the population \\(\\sigma\\) is known, is given by: \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the population.\n\\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nThis implies: as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the distribution of means or SEM decreases. This means that larger samples lead to more precise estimates of the population mean.\nAs an example if 30 students are measured and if you were to average the scores of many groups of 30 students, the average scores (means) would vary less than the individual scores within each group. This reduced variability is captured by the standard error.\nThe Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) is a statistical measure that estimates the variability of the sample mean relative to the true population mean. It essentially tells you how much the sample means \\(\\bar X\\) is expected to fluctuate from the actual population mean \\(\\mu\\) if you were to take multiple samples from the same population.\nThe SEM is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. It quantifies the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.\nFormula: \\(\\text{SEM} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\n\\(\\sigma\\): Population standard deviation.\n\\(n\\): Sample size.\n\nIf the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) can be used as an estimate: \\(\\text{SEM} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\nIn this case we denote the SEM as \\(s_{\\bar X}\\).\nInterpretation:\n\nA smaller SEM indicates that the sample mean is a more accurate reflection of the population mean, meaning there is less variability in the sample means across different samples.\nA larger SEM suggests more variability among sample means, implying that the sample mean might not be as close to the population mean.\n\nApplication:\n\nConfidence Intervals: SEM is often used to construct confidence intervals for the population mean. For instance, a 95% confidence interval gives a range that likely contains the true population mean.\nHypothesis Testing: In hypothesis testing, SEM is used to assess whether a sample mean significantly differs from a hypothesized population mean.\n\nExample 1: ONE sample from the Population:\n(In this example we do not have a sampling distribution)\nSuppose you have a sample of 100 students, and you want to estimate the average height of all students at a university. You calculate the sample mean height \\(\\bar{x}\\) and the sample standard deviation \\(s\\).\n\nSample Size (n): 100\nSample Standard Deviation (s): 5 cm\n\nThe Standard Error of the Mean is calculated as: \\(\\text{SEM} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \\text{ cm}\\)\nNote that here we have used one large sample n=100 to compute the mean and standard deviation. And then used this standard deviation to compute SEM. The advantage is that the large sample size takes effect on the precision of our estimates making it more reliable and giving us a lower SEM.\nSummary:\nThe Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) provides a measure of how well a sample mean estimates the true population mean. A lower SEM indicates a more reliable sample mean, while a higher SEM suggests more variability and less reliability. It plays a crucial role in statistical inference, particularly in constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests.\nWe can compute the SEM for multiple samples.\nExample 2: Multiple samples from the Population\nIn this example we do have a sampling distribution as we are taking multiple samples from the population.\nStep 1: Define a Population\nWe don’t know the exact population mean or standard deviation, and our goal is to estimate them using samples.\n\nPopulation: Test scores of all students in a large school.\nPopulation Mean: Unknown.\nPopulation Standard Deviation: Unknown.\n\nStep 2: Take Multiple Samples from the Population\nWe take 4 random samples, each consisting of 5 students’ test scores.\n\nSample 1: 78, 82, 85, 90, 92\nSample 2: 72, 88, 80, 76, 84\nSample 3: 95, 92, 85, 87, 90\nSample 4: 68, 75, 70, 80, 82\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Mean for Each Sample\nNow, we calculate the mean of each sample:\n\nMean of Sample 1: \\(\\bar{X}_1 = \\frac{78 + 82 + 85 + 90 + 92}{5} = \\frac{427}{5} = 85.4\\)\nMean of Sample 2: \\(\\bar{X}_2 = \\frac{72 + 88 + 80 + 76 + 84}{5} = \\frac{400}{5} = 80\\)\nMean of Sample 3: \\(\\bar{X}_3 = \\frac{95 + 92 + 85 + 87 + 90}{5} = \\frac{449}{5} = 89.8\\)\nMean of Sample 4: \\(\\bar{X}_4 = \\frac{68 + 75 + 70 + 80 + 82}{5} = \\frac{375}{5} = 75\\)\n\nStep 4: Create a Distribution of the Sample Means\nNow that we have the means of the four samples:\n\nSample 1 Mean: 85.4\nSample 2 Mean: 80\nSample 3 Mean: 89.8\nSample 4 Mean: 75\n\nWe can now create a distribution of these sample means.\nStep 5: Calculate the Mean of the Sample Means\n\\(\\text{Mean of Sample Means} = \\frac{85.4 + 80 + 89.8 + 75}{4} = \\frac{330.2}{4} = 82.55\\) ⇒ we can call this the grand mean \\((\\bar {\\bar {x}})\\).\nSo, the mean of the sample means is \\(\\bar {\\bar {x}}\\)= 82.55.\nStep 6: Calculate the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)\nStep 6.1: Calculate the Standard Deviation of the Sample Means\nTo calculate the SEM, we need the standard deviation of the sample means. We will treat the sample means as data points and calculate their standard deviation.\n\nDeviations of Each Sample Mean from the Mean of Sample Means:\n\n$(85.4 - 82.55)^2 = 8.1225$\n\n$(80 - 82.55)^2 = 6.5025$\n\n$(89.8 - 82.55)^2 = 52.0225$\n\n$(75 - 82.55)^2 = 57.0025$\n\nSum the Squared Deviations: \\(\\text{Sum of Squared Deviations} = 8.1225 + 6.5025 + 52.0225 + 57.0025 = 123.65\\)\nCalculate the Variance by dividing by \\(n-1\\) (degrees of freedom, where \\(n = 4\\): \\(\\text{Variance} = \\frac{123.65}{3} \\approx 41.2167\\)\nCalculate the Standard Deviation \\(s\\) by taking the square root of the variance: \\(s = \\sqrt{41.2167} \\approx 6.42\\): this \\(s\\) is the standard deviation of the sample means: variability around the grand mean \\((\\bar {\\bar {x}})\\)\n\nStep 6.2: Use the Standard Deviation to Calculate SEM\nNow that we have the standard deviation of the sample means ($s = 6.42$), we can calculate the SEM using the formula: \\(\\text{SEM} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{6.42}{\\sqrt{4}} = \\frac{6.42}{2} = 3.21\\)\nFinal Answer:\n\nMean of the Sample Means: 82.55\nStandard Error of the Mean (SEM): 3.21\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem: In short this theory states that if we take a large enough sample (usually &gt;30) then our sampling distribution approaches normality.\n\n\n\nZ-Scores in the Context of Sampling Distribution\nAfter having calculated the SEM from multiple samples, the next step is often to construct the confidence interval — an interval that contains the true parameter value with a certain degree of confidence such as 80%, 90%, 95% (most common) and 99%. Our hypothesised \\(\\mu\\), which we have estimated using a large sample $(n\\ge 30)$, is our point estimate. As mentioned this is an estimate of the population mean \\(\\mu\\), and due to sampling error this estimate of the mean may not be valid, but it is our best guess and likely very close to the true population mean.\nFor a z-test, you need to know:\n\nThe population standard deviation (σ)\nEither: a) The population mean (μ) if you’re comparing a sample to a known population OR b) The hypothesised difference between means if you’re comparing two populations\n\nIt’s important to note:\n\nYou don’t always need to know the population mean for all types of z-tests.\nThe critical element is knowing the population standard deviation (σ).\n\nHere are the common scenarios:\n\nOne-sample z-test:\n\nYou know the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$ )\n\nYou know or hypothesize a population mean ($\\mu$)\n\nYou compare your sample mean to this known/hypothesized population mean\n\nTwo-sample z-test:\n\nYou know the population standard deviations for both populations\n\nYou don't necessarily need to know the population means\n\nYou're testing if there's a significant difference between the two population means\n\nZ-test for proportions:\n\nUsed for categorical data\n\nYou don't need to know means or standard deviations\n\nYou use the properties of the binomial distribution\nSo, to summarize: for a z-test, you always need to know the population standard deviation(s), but you don’t always need to know the population mean(s). The population mean might be what you’re testing against or trying to estimate.\nIn the context of a sampling distribution, z-scores are used to determine how unusual or typical a sample mean is relative to the population mean. The z-test is a statistical method that allows you to test whether the difference between a sample mean and the known population mean is statistically significant or whether it could be attributed to sampling error. OR if we are computing the means for to population, we need to know the hypothesised difference between the two populations.\nExample:\n\nPopulation Mean (μ): 100\nPopulation Standard Deviation (σ): 15\nSample Mean ( \\(\\bar{x}\\) ): 95\nSample Size (n): 36\n\nTo determine if the difference between the sample mean and the population mean is due to random sampling error or if the sample is likely not from the same population we conduct a Z test.\n\n\n\nSteps to Conduct a Z-Test:\n\nCalculate the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM):\nThe SEM represents the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. It is calculated using the formula: \\(\\text{SEM} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{36}} = \\frac{15}{6} = 2.5\\)\nCalculate the Z-Score:\n\nThe z-score tells you how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the population mean. The formula for calculating the z-score in this context is: \\(z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\text{SEM}} = \\frac{95 - 100}{2.5} = \\frac{-5}{2.5} = -2\\) This z-score of -2 means that the sample mean is 2 standard errors below the population mean.\n\nCompare the Z-Score to the Critical Value:\n\nIn many cases, you use a z-table or a standard normal distribution table to find the probability associated with the z-score. However, in hypothesis testing, you often compare the z-score to a critical value. The critical value depends on the confidence level you are working with:\n\nFor a 95% confidence level, the critical z-values are ±1.96.\n\nSince our calculated z-score is -2, which is less than -1.96, it falls outside the range of what is typically expected if the sample were drawn from this population.\nInterpretation:\n\nIf the z-score falls within the range of -1.96 to 1.96, the difference between the sample mean and the population mean could likely be due to random sampling error.\nIf the z-score falls outside this range, as it does in our example, it suggests that the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean. Therefore, it’s unlikely that this sample comes from the population with a mean of 100.\n\nUnderstanding the 1.96 Rule:\nThe “1.96 rule” corresponds to a 95% confidence interval in a standard normal distribution. It means that if the sample mean is more than 1.96 standard errors away from the population mean, there is less than a 5% probability that the sample mean is from the same population (under the assumption of a normal distribution).\n\nConclusion:\nIn this example, because the z-score of -2 falls outside the critical range of ±1.96, we would reject the null hypothesis that the sample mean is equal to the population mean. This suggests that the observed difference is statistically significant and not just due to random sampling error. It raises the possibility that this sample may come from a different population."
