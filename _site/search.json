    "text": "The Housing Crisis in Australia\nIn the recent times, there has been a huge debate in Australia surrounding the affordability of housing in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne where the median house price has reached to $1.6 million and $1.03 respectively. The price of housing itself does not tell us much about the affordability but the comparison between the cost of purchasing a house and household income levels reveal an actual economic situation.\n\n\n\nDomain House Prices"

    "text": "Series Part 1\nRecently, a significant debate has emerged in Australia regarding housing affordability, particularly in major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne where the median house prices have soared to $1.6 million and $1.03 million respectively. However, measuring affordability extends beyond the mere cost of owning a home; it involves comparing median household income levels against median house prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian House Price in Melbourne\n\n\nThis concept can be better illustrated with an example. As of March 2024, purchasing a property in Melbourne costs approximately $1.03 million. To buy such a property, a potential homeowner would need to save a $200,000 deposit for the down payment and then secure a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 6.5% per annum. This arrangement translates to a weekly mortgage payment of around $1,200. According to the August release of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the average full-time adult worker in Australia earns about $1,995 per week. Consequently, approximately 60% of a typical full-time worker’s weekly earnings would be devoted to mortgage payments.\nIt’s not just expensive for home owners but those in the rental market have also been severely impacted. Over the past two years, the rent has surged for over 40% in Australia. The national average rent has reached $627 p/w. In Melbourne the median rent is $589 p/w, with a year-on-year increase of 9.6%, one of the highest in the country. Rent growth in Melbourne is particularly high in the suburbs of Dandenong (16.2%), Tullamarine-Broadmeadows (14.1%), and Whittlesea-Wallan (14%). As a result, the renters are being forced into the outskirts of major cities and regional areas. The rising rents are part of a cost-of-living crisis, with demand increasing in previously more affordable areas, pushing prices even higher.

    "text": "In this blog I would like to briefly discuss the macroeconomic backdrop of China’s economy. China is Australia’s largest trading partner, accounting for nearly a third of all exports. It serves as the primary destination for many of Australia’s key goods and services, mainly resources such as coal, iron ore, and gold, making this bilateral economic relationship crucial to Australia’s economic prosperity.\nIn recent years, China’s economic slowdown has raised significant concerns among policymakers and economists worldwide regarding its potential impact on the global economy. As one of the largest consumers of energy, China plays a critical role in global demand for resources, and its decelerating growth has sparked questions about the future of macroeconomic stability, particularly for countries like Australia, which are heavily reliant on resource exports to China.\n\nAustralia-China bilateral trade\nAustralia’s exports to China are heavily dominated by resources and energy, such as iron ore, natural gas, and gold. As China’s economy evolves, particularly with its growing middle class, the trade relationship is diversifying to include premium agricultural products, financial services, healthcare, aged care, and professional services.\nChina surpassed $326.9 billion as Australia’s largest two-way trading partner in 2023, and continues to account for nearly a third of Australia’s exports. &lt;ref&gt;“https://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/china/china-country-brief#:~:text=China%20is%20Australia’s%20largest%20two,in%202023%2C%20totalling%20%24326.9%20billion.”&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nService exports: Service exports to China reached $10.3 billion in 2020-21, highlighting sectors such as education, tourism, and professional services.\n\n\n\nInvestment\nResources and energy also play a pivotal role in bilateral investments. Chinese foreign investment in Australia contributes to critical infrastructure, productivity, and job creation. At the same time, Australian businesses have found success in sectors like banking and wealth management in China, allowing them to tap into this vast, sophisticated market.\n\nInvestment figures: By 2021, the total stock of two-way investment between Australia and China reached $166.8 billion. China was Australia’s 8th largest investor, with investments valued at $92 billion, while Australia’s investment in China stood at $74.8 billion, making it the 12th largest destination for Australian investments.\n\n\n\nHigh-Level Economic Engagement\nThe China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) further strengthens the bilateral mechanisms in place, facilitating trade and economic collaboration. Both countries share interests in multilateral platforms like the G20, APEC, and the World Trade Organization, with a mutual commitment to shaping global and regional economic policies.\nThis broad engagement reflects the significance of China-Australia relations across multiple sectors, ensuring a future of continued collaboration and growth."
