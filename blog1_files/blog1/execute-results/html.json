However, measuring affordability extends beyond the mere cost of owning a home; it involves comparing median household income levels against median house prices.\n\n[![Median House Price in Melbourne](domain-img.png){fig-align=\"left\"}](https://www.domain.com.au/research/house-price-report/march-2024/#melbourne)\n\nThis concept can be better illustrated with an example. As of March 2024, purchasing a property in Melbourne costs approximately \\$1.03 million. To buy such a property, a potential homeowner would need to save a \\$200,000 deposit for the down payment and then secure a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 6.5% per annum. This arrangement translates to a weekly mortgage payment of around \\$1,200. According to the August release of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the average full-time adult worker in Australia earns about \\$1,995 per week. Consequently, approximately 60% of a typical full-time worker's weekly earnings would be devoted to mortgage payments.\n\nIt's not just expensive for home owners but those in the rental market have also been severely impacted. Over the past two years, the rent has surged for over 40% in Australia. The national average rent has reached \\$627 p/w. In Melbourne the median rent is \\$589 p/w, with a year-on-year increase of **9.6%**, one of the highest in the country. Rent growth in Melbourne is particularly high in the suburbs of Dandenong (16.2%), Tullamarine-Broadmeadows (14.1%), and Whittlesea-Wallan (14%). As a result, the renters are being forced into the outskirts of major cities and regional areas. The rising rents are part of a cost-of-living crisis, with demand increasing in previously more affordable areas, pushing prices even higher.
