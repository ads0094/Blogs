In this blog I would like to briefly discuss the macroeconomic backdrop of China's economy. China is Australia's largest trading partner, accounting for nearly a third of all exports. It serves as the primary destination for many of Australia’s key goods and services, mainly resources such as coal, iron ore, and gold, making this bilateral economic relationship crucial to Australia’s economic prosperity.

In recent years, China's economic slowdown has raised significant concerns among policymakers and economists worldwide regarding its potential impact on the global economy. As one of the largest consumers of energy, China plays a critical role in global demand for resources, and its decelerating growth has sparked questions about the future of macroeconomic stability, particularly for countries like Australia, which are heavily reliant on resource exports to China.

#### Australia-China bilateral trade

Australia's exports to China are heavily dominated by resources and energy, such as iron ore, natural gas, and gold. As China’s economy evolves, particularly with its growing middle class, the trade relationship is diversifying to include premium agricultural products, financial services, healthcare, aged care, and professional services.

China surpassed \$326.9 billion as Australia's largest two-way trading partner in 2023, and continues to account for nearly a third of Australia’s exports. The goods and services export to China was valued at \$218.8 billion in 2023, an increase of 18.2 per cent, compared to the previous financial year. Services exports soared 53.4 per cent in the same period, driven largely by the return of tourists and students to Australia.

#### Investment

By 2021, the total stock of two-way investment between Australia and China reached \$166.8 billion. China was Australia’s 8th largest FD investor, with investments valued at \$92 billion, while Australia’s investment in China stood at \$74.8 billion, making it the 12th largest destination for Australian investments. In recent years, China's investment in Australia has broadened from mainly mining to other sectors including infrastructure and healthcare.

### Macroeconomic Backdrop of China's Economy

Over the past decade, China has implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at transitioning its economy to a more market-oriented system. Key among these reforms has been the gradual liberalisation of the yuan (CNY) and interest rate policies. The People’s Bank of China has allowed the currency to fluctuate within a broader range, aligning more closely with market forces rather than being strictly managed by central authorities. Interest rate liberalisation has also been introduced to make the financial system more flexible and responsive to market conditions. In addition, China has actively promoted foreign investment, particularly in high-tech sectors, establishing itself as a leader in technology, anti-trust regulation, and the electric vehicle (EV) industry.

Despite these advances, significant concerns remain about China's economy. China's debt-to-GDP ratio has surpassed 300%, which is considered alarmingly high by international standards. This debt burden, much of which is concentrated in local governments and state-owned enterprises, has raised doubts about the long-term sustainability of China’s growth model.

#### Local Government Debt and Ghost Cities

The root of many of China’s economic challenges stems from local governments being tasked with meeting aggressive GDP targets. In their quest to drive rapid growth, these governments often engaged in extensive infrastructure development, leading to the creation of so-called “ghost cities”—vast urban areas that remain largely unoccupied and fail to generate economic returns. These unproductive assets have become a major burden on local government finances, further contributing to China's high debt levels.

#### Deleveraging Efforts: The Three Red Lines Policy

In response to rising debt, the Chinese government introduced the **Three Red Lines policy** in 2020. This set strict limits on the borrowing capacity of property developers based on three key financial ratios: debt to cash assets, debt to equity, and debt to liabilities. The policy aimed to reduce the excessive leverage in the real estate sector but has inadvertently slowed growth, as developers faced liquidity issues and reduced construction activities. This deleveraging process has contributed to disinflation, where inflation rises at a slower pace, raising concerns about potential deflation. Deflation is problematic in an economy burdened by high debt, as it reduces profits, making it harder to service debt.

#### Demographic Decline and Consumption Challenges

The introduction of the **one-child policy** in 1979 has resulted in a significant demographic decline in China, with fewer young people entering the workforce. This aging population has created structural challenges for consumption-led growth, as the most active consumers—those aged 20 to 45—are shrinking as a proportion of the population. Many young couples are deterred from having more children due to economic pressures and the responsibility of supporting elderly family members. This demographic trend has forced China to rely increasingly on export-led growth, deepening its dependence on global trade partners at a time when international tariffs and protectionist policies are rising.

#### Uncertain Business Environment and Regulation

Chinese companies are also navigating a complex regulatory landscape. The government’s deleveraging efforts, combined with external pressures such as tariffs on Chinese goods, have created uncertainty in the business environment. Deleveraging could lead to defaults, particularly in the property sector, where debt is highest. Moreover, as China seeks to maintain its economic model, there is a growing concern that Western countries may inadvertently subsidise this model through continued trade relations, despite existing trade tensions.

In summary, while China has made significant strides in reforming its economy, its high debt levels, demographic challenges, and reliance on external trade partners present substantial risks to its future stability.

### Implications for Australia

In recent years, tensions between the two nations led to a series of trade restrictions imposed by China on Australian exports. However, with the Labor government now in power, there has been a noticeable improvement in diplomatic relations, which has eased some of the economic pressures previously felt.

Despite concerns that trade restrictions could hurt Australia’s trade balance, the country demonstrated remarkable economic resilience. During the height of the tensions, Australia's trade surplus hit record levels. A significant factor in this success was Australia's ability to diversify its export markets. While restrictions from China affected agricultural exports like barley and wine, Australia successfully redirected these exports to countries such as South-east Asia, and found newer markets for Australia's agricultural products such as the UK. Similarly, Australia's coal exports to China were disrupted during the trade conflict, which led Australia to seek alternative markets in Asia, particularly in countries like Japan and South Korea. By 2023, as diplomatic ties improved, China resumed importing Australian coal, further stabilising the energy export market.

#### Iron Ore and Industrial Demand

Iron ore, however, remains the cornerstone of Australia’s export relationship with China. Iron ore accounts for approximately 60% of Australia's total exports to China, driven by China’s industrial needs, particularly in steel production. While China's real estate market has faced a downturn, its demand for steel for infrastructure and industrial purposes remains robust. Given China's substantial infrastructure projects and high nominal GDP, it is likely that iron ore demand will remain strong, even though real GDP growth has slowed in recent years.

#### Long-Term Risks and Diversification Strategies

Although Australia has successfully navigated the short-term impact of trade tensions with China, the long-term risks associated with its heavy reliance on iron ore exports remain. Any significant reduction in China's steel production or a shift in demand for iron ore due to environmental policies could affect Australia's trade balance. Additionally, increasing competition in the global iron ore market poses challenges for Australia. However, Australia's diversification into new markets and sectors, such as renewable energy and other commodities, may help offset some of these risks over time.

In summary, while the Australia-China trade relationship has experienced challenges, Australia's ability to adapt and diversify its export markets has allowed it to maintain economic stability. However, given its reliance on iron ore and China’s shifting economic policies, Australia must remain vigilant and continue exploring alternative markets to ensure long-term macroeconomic stability.
